Great! Here's a concise **Twitter (X) version** of your **Task 3: Pipeline Power!** submission that fits the character limit and includes hashtags and tagging as required:

---

> 💻 Ever wondered how `history | cut -c 8- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head` actually works?
>
> I used @ChatGPT with Code Interpreter to break it down line by line 🔍
>
> Now I get how data flows through pipes — not just the output, but *why* it works!
>
> \#ALX\_SE #ALX\_BE #Linux #Bash @alx\_africa

---

Optional follow-up tweet in a thread (if you want to go deeper):

> Each command passes its output (stdout) to the next via the pipe `|`.
>
> `cd | ls` fails because `cd` doesn't output anything + runs in a subshell.
>
> Lesson: Understanding *how* commands connect is just as important as the result! 🔧
